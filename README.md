# DTSA-5509 Supervised Learning Final Project

<p><b>California Housing Data</b></p>

<p><i>In this repository you will find the Jupyter Notebook related to my final project.</i></p>

<p><b>Problem Description</b></p>
<p>The goal of this project is gain insight into house values across California. If California were a country, it would be the fifth largest economy in the world. From a personal or business perspective, the ability to identify housing and wealth trends across the state presents a wide variety of practical applications, for example, identiying an affordable home to purchase, locating a suitable neighborhood in which to establish a retail store and/or gaining insights to socio-economic trends across the state.</p>

<p>With no familiarity with the data nor subject, we will utilize unsupervised learning models to gain insights by analyzing the raw data to group sets of observed locations based on intrinsic similarities. With clusters identified, we can examine the characteristics that make them similar to better understand the housing values across California. If we are able to identify labels associated with our clusters, we will then seek to use supervised learning methods with the potential to predict these labels.</p>

<p><b>About the data...</b></p>
<p>The project is utilizing the California Housing dataset from Kaggle..  It is the second most popular dataset on the UCI Machine Learning Repository,
categorized for use in multivariate classification and the data was extracted from the 1994 census database. The dataset provides 14 attribute variables that
are a mixture of categorical, ordinal, and numerical data types as well as the target variable for income.</p>
